MySQL database schema and scripts for managing bookstore data
# Bookstore Database Project

**Overview**

This repository contains the files for a database design and programming project focused on creating a MySQL database for a bookstore. The goal is to build a relational database that efficiently stores and manages information about books, authors, customers, orders, and more.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

* **MySQL:** For building and managing the database.
* **Draw.io (diagrams.net):** For visualizing the database schema and relationships (schema diagram included in this repository).

**Project Objectives**

* Design and implement a MySQL database for a real-world bookstore use case.
* Create tables with optimal schema and data types for the dataset.
* Establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
* Set up basic user roles and permissions in MySQL (implementation may vary based on scope).
* Demonstrate the ability to query the database to retrieve and analyze data (example queries may be included).

**Files Included**

* `bookstore_schema.drawio` (or a exported image like `bookstore_schema.png`): The Draw.io diagram visualizing the database schema.
* `bookstore_creation_script.sql`: The SQL script containing the `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.
* (Optional) `bookstore_user_setup.sql`: SQL script for creating users and granting privileges.
* (Optional) `sample_data_insertion.sql`: SQL script to insert some sample data for testing.
* (Optional) `example_queries.sql`: A file containing example SQL queries to demonstrate data retrieval.

**How to Run (or Review)**

1.  **Schema Visualization:** Open the `bookstore_schema.drawio` file (or the image) to view the visual design of the database.
2.  **Database Creation:** Execute the `bookstore_creation_script.sql` file in your MySQL environment to create the `bookstore` database and its tables.
3.  **(Optional) User Setup:** Run the `bookstore_user_setup.sql` to create users with specific permissions.
4.  **(Optional) Sample Data:** Execute `sample_data_insertion.sql` to populate the tables with some initial data for testing.
5.  **(Optional) Example Queries:** Run the queries in `example_queries.sql` to see how data can be retrieved and analyzed.

**Submission Notes**

* This repository represents the completed work for the Database Design & Programming with SQL assignment.
* The database is designed according to the specifications provided in the assignment brief.
